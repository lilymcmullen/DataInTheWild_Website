*Data in the Wild* introduces students to data science through the R programming language, applied to real problems in ecology and conservation. The course is built around a narrative, a mission to establish a sustainable colony in Antarctica, in which each module presents a new crisis for students to investigate using data. No prior programming experience is required.

The course was developed by Drs. Katy Prudic, Jeff Oliver, Keaton Wilson, and Ellen Bledsoe with support from the NSF Harnessing the Data Revolution program, and is taught at the University of Arizona as part of the general education curriculum.

## **The Narrative**

### **Module 1: Mission Antarctica!**

The team has arrived in Antarctica and needs to get to work. Students are introduced to RStudio, R, and RMarkdown by helping the team get organized and begin collecting data. By the end of this module, students can navigate RStudio, write and run basic R code, work with data frames, and produce simple visualizations.

### **Module 2: Good Food Gone Bad**

A wave of food poisoning has swept through the team. Doctors have ruled out a viral infection, something in the food supply is to blame. Students use descriptive statistics, data visualization with `ggplot2`, and simulation to identify which food source is responsible and what conditions in the aquaculture system are driving the problem.

### **Module 3: Follow That Seal**

Wild-caught fish are needed to supplement the food supply, but leopard seals are putting fishing teams at risk. The team has been tracking seals with radio collars from two manufacturers, but collars are failing earlier than expected. Students determine which manufacturer is responsible (battery life, not signal distance) using t-tests and ANOVA, then use joins and binds to combine datasets from multiple sources, and finally apply a K-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm to identify the maker of a batch of unlabeled collars. Skills covered include hypothesis testing, multi-group comparison, data joining, and an introduction to machine learning.

### **Module 4: March of the Penguins**

Fishing bays have been identified, but a road is needed to reach them. The team wants to avoid destroying habitat for Antarctica hairgrass (*Deschampsia antarctica*), one of only two flowering plants on the continent, and avoid disturbing Gentoo penguin nesting sites. Students build linear and multiple regression models to identify environmental predictors of hairgrass density and penguin nesting success, then write their own functions to automate the analysis across candidate road routes. Skills covered include simple and multiple linear regression, model interpretation, and writing user-defined functions in R.

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1.  Apply computational methods for managing, analyzing, visualizing, and sharing data in the context of real-world natural resource scenarios.
2.  Infer meaning and insight from data and communicate findings in written, visual, and verbal form to multiple audiences.
3.  Think critically across disciplines, consider multiple perspectives, and solve problems using data-informed approaches.

## **For Instructors**

Course materials, including student and instructor versions of all lessons, datasets, and assignments, are openly available and designed to be adaptable for other institutions and programming languages. R is used throughout, but the course structure is transferable to Python or other environments.

All materials are available on the [course site](structure.qmd) and in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BiodiversityDataScienceCorp/DataInTheWild_UA).
